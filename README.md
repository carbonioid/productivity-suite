# Timetracker
Simple timetracker made in JS and Python. Made mostly for personal use, but you're free to test it out if curious. Everything is saved on disk as CSV so you can use it in other places and it is saved across refreshes.

> Controls: Add items to your day using the form at the top; double-click on items to edit them (leave the "name" field blank to delete); everything else is self-evident

To use, run `python3 src/app.py` then access at `127.0.0.1:8000`
